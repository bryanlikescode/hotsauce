General Walkthrough for securing windows AD

These first couple are interchangeable, but should all be first priority when the competition starts. 
Injects can wait until these first couple are all complete.

- change default Administrator password. Use the guide/password we prepare before the competition.
- configure/activate firewall
- remove unauthorized users, emphasis on unauthorized administrators
- restrict administrator priviledges. in "GPO > Administrator Settings"
  the restriction should only allow administrators to do what is expected. Use common sense.
- Download the github repository. 
  In the "AD scripts" folder, open "scripts" and then see the "Download GitHub" file for instructions.
  It works in the practice environment if you want to try it out. Fingers crossed it will work on competition day.

These next few should be done when you have time. If an inject comes in, complete it first. 
Otherwise, when you have time complete the below tasks.

- If they are not already (you should check) block ports 445 and 139 completely. Don't allow anything through
  these ports.
- Add logon banner
  below text is what you should use. You can copy and paste this, just make sure to FIX DATE & TEAM NUMBER
  When pasting, windows does not wrap the text on the logon screen, so hit enter every once in a while to 
  "wrap" it yourself:
  
  WARNING

Team ## reserves the right to consent to a valid law enforcement request to search the network logs for evidence of a crime stored within the network and can be used to prosecute abuse.

- Create a password policy. 
  use common good practice
- NTP Setup
  There is a PNG of this on github. use it for reference also see the following link
  https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-DaaS/services/horizondaas.install910/GUID-AEC90E5F-C5B6-447F-B03F-C1060C405E1F.html
- Stop and disable printspooler. This is in the services screen.
- Enable BitLocker. This is also in the services screen.

Once these are done, all you should do is focus on injects, help others (please), and every once in a while do a check 
up on the machine to make sure nothing weird is going on. If there is something else of importance I forgot to note here, 
feel free to add.
