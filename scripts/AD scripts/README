General Walkthrough for securing windows AD

These first couple are interchangeable, but should all be first priority when the competition starts. 
Injects can wait until these first couple are all complete.

- change default Administrator password. Use the guide/password we prepare before the competition.
- configure/activate firewall
- remove unauthorized users, emphasis on unauthorized administrators
- restrict administrator priviledges. in "GPO > Administrator Settings"
  the restriction should only allow administrators to do what is expected. Use common sense.
- Download the github repository. 
  In the "AD scripts" folder, open "scripts" and then see the download github file.

These next few should be done when you have time. Also should probably be done in this order, unless
an inject specifies one of these to be done immediately.

- If they are not already (you should check) block ports 445 and 139 completely. Don't allow anything through
  these ports.
- Add logon banner
  below text is what you should use. You can copy and paste this, just make sure to FIX DATE & TEAM NUMBER
  When pasting, windows does not wrap the text on the logon screen, so hit enter every once in a while to 
  "wrap" it yourself:
  
  WARNING

Team ## reserves the right to consent to a valid law enforcement request to search the network logs for evidence of a crime stored within the network and can be used to prosecute abuse.
